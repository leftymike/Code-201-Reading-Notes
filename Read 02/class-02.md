Here are some quick notes taken from the reading assignment (HTML & CSS, and Javascript and JQuery by Jon Duckett).
HTML is used to add content to a file and uses many different tags that allow the developer to format the content in the desired manner. HTML "tags" are denoted by some character(s) in between the < and > sign, such as a p, to signify a paragraph.

CSS is used to style the HTML elements either inline (on the same page as the HTML) or externally (on a separate file linked to the HTML document). CSS uses what are called "selectors" to style HTML attributes. Once an attribute has been selected, the assigned property and value are used to determine how the HTML attribute is styled.

Javascript is used to add functions to a page. Javascript uses statements, which are essentially line by line instructions to make a function happen. Statements should start on a new line and end with a semicolon. Statements can be organized into "code blocks" using curly braces. Javascript uses Variables as a way to call a function. There are several Data Types used in Javascript. Numbers, Strings, Booleans (true or false), arrays, objects, undefined, and null are all Data Types.
