### HTML Lists
There are 3 types of HTML lists. Ordered, Unordered, and Definition lists. Ordered lists are numbered while unordered lists use bullet points. 
Definition lists define terminology. 
You can nest a list inside of a list. 

### CSS Boxes
CSS allows you to put boxes around HTML elements. You can control the dimensions of the boxes, create borders around boxes, set margins and padding for boxes, and show and hide boxes. 
To adjust width and height you adjust the number of pixels (200px, 300px, etc.). 
To adjust for screen sizes you can set the minimum and maximum widths (and heights) of a box. 
The overflow property allows you to hide content that is too large for a box (you may add a scroll feature to allow the user to see the hidden content).
The border width, style, and color can be adjusted. 
The padding property lets you specify how much space should appear between the content and the border.
The margin property lets you control the gap between boxes.
The display property allows you to turn n inline element into a block-level element, and vice versa. It can also be used to hide an element. 
The visibility element allows you hide boxes from users but leavs a space where the element would have been.
The border-image property applies an image to the border of any box. It takes a backgound image and slices it into 9 pieces. 
The box-shadow property allows you to add a drop shadow around a box. 
The border-radius property allows your box to have rounded corners and create different shapes.

### Javascript 
#### Arrays
An array stores a list of values (not just one).
Values in an array are separated by commas, inside of square brackets. You can store different data types inside of an array. This technique is called an array literal.
Values in an array accessed as if they are in a numbered list (starting at 0). pages 70-73
#### Using if..else statements. 
If..else chaecks a condition (or is a conditional statement). if it resolves to true, then that code block is executed. If the condition resolves to false, then the second code block. is executed. 
Switch statements start with the "switch" value. Each case indicates a possible value for the variable and the code should run if the variable matches the value. These statements have the potential to run faster than if/if...else statements due to the inclusion of a break statement that stops code from runnning in that code block. 
It is better to use strict equals operators (=== and !== rather than == and !=) as these check that the value and data types match and can help keep errors down.
Loops will run until a condition returns as false. (for, while, do while).
All values evaluate to either truthy or falsy.
There are 3 types of loops: for, while, and do...while.
