### HTML Lists
There are 3 types of HTML lists. Ordered, Unordered, and Definition lists. Ordered lists are numbered while unordered lists use bullet points. 
Definition lists define terminology. 
You can nest a list inside of a list. 

### CSS Boxes
CSS allows you to put boxes around HTML elements. You can control the dimensions of the boxes, create borders around boxes, set margins and padding for boxes, and show and hide boxes. 
To adjust width and height you adjust the number of pixels (200px, 300px, etc.). 
To adjust for screen sizes you can set the minimum and maximum widths (and heights) of a box. 
The overflow property allows you to hide content that is too large for a box (you may add a scroll feature to allow the user to see the hidden content).
The border width, style, and color can be adjusted. 
The padding property lets you specify how much space should appear between the content and the border.
The margin property lets you control the gap between boxes.
The display property allows you to turn n inline element into a block-level element, and vice versa. It can also be used to hide an element. 
The visibility element allows you hide boxes from users but leavs a space where the element would have been.
The border-image property applies an image to the border of any box. It takes a backgound image and slices it into 9 pieces. 
The box-shadow property allows you to add a drop shadow around a box. 
The border-radius property allows your box to have rounded corners and create different shapes.
